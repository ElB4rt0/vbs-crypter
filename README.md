# Information

This small script will encrypt (encode) any VBS file. The encryption is dynamic, if you encrypt the same VBS file 5 times, you will get 5 different encrypted files (with different MD5 hash, etc). You can try to encrypt and encrypted file, but the size of the final file will grow fast.


# Usage

Download vbs-crypter.vbs, then drag&drop your VBS file over vbs-crypter.vbs, in a few seconds a new file will be created on the same directory with the code encrypted. You can identify the encrypted file because it will be renamed, appending a dash at then end of file name.


### Crypter or Encoder?

In fact, this script encodes VBS files. Any experienced user can decode the encrypted file manually. This just adds a layer of obfuscation to your files, and can bypass most of AV
